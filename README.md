# GitHub API Task

In this repository you may ssee a simple Node.JS code for retrieving data from GitHub API

A simple API is develped to search within GitHub repositories for a specific keyword and return the results as JSON objects.

To use the code, after downloading the repository, navigate to **backend** folder in a terminal (command prompt) and run:
```
node ./index.js
```
After the server started, you may see the message:
```
The server starts on local host and port: 3000
```
Simple http "get" queries can be sent to the URL
```
127.0.0.1:3000/search
```
Queries must have three mandatory parameters:
```
keyword: can be anything
sort_by: can be chosen from 'stars', 'forks', or 'updated'
order: can be 'asc' for 'ascending' or 'desc' for descending
```
A very simple and uncomplete front end is also developed. the file are available in the **frontend** folder.
While the server is runnign, the front end can be seen in the URL
```
127.0.0.1:3000/
```
